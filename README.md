The Evolution of RAG 🧬
From Blind Retrieval to Autonomous Reasoning
Welcome to the code companion for the blog series "The Evolution of RAG." This repository is not just a collection of scripts; it is a documented journey through the cognitive shift in AI architecture.
We deconstruct the logic behind Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), moving beyond simple vector search to build systems that plan, route, and reason. Each directory represents a distinct evolutionary stage, designed to prove why the previous architecture failed and how the next one solves it.
🧠 Architectures Covered:
Naive RAG (The Baseline): The foundational "Retrieve-Read" pipeline.
Focus: Vector Embeddings, Cosine Similarity, and the "Context Fragmentation" failure mode.
Advanced RAG (The Optimization): Introducing precision and quality control.
Focus: Query Expansion, Hybrid Search (Dense + Sparse), Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and Cross-Encoder Reranking.
Modular RAG (The Switchboard): Breaking the monolith.
Focus: Dynamic Routing, Intent Classification, and specialized sub-modules (Vector vs. Keyword).
Agentic RAG (The Reasoner): The shift to autonomy.
Focus: ReAct Loops (Reason+Act), Tool Use, Planning, and Multi-hop reasoning.
